# **AllenKong:  It's a screwed up version on Donkey Kong were you take control of Allen and help him to reach his dream 1 Million points. ** #

Tested with latest MAME version 0.250

Fully compatible with all MAME versions from 0.196


Donkey Kong but with Allen instead of Jumpman.  Warning:  This game contains Allen and lots of naughty words.
The game includes approx 350 sound samples,  mostly obtained from Allen's Twitch channel at https://www.twitch.tv/muscleandfitness

You have the option to start the game from level 1, 5, 12 or 17 and you will be on pace for that big big big 1 Million points.

This work wouldn't be possible without the help of Luke @Mr2NuT123 and the co-operation and consent of Allen Staal @muscleandfitness himself.
